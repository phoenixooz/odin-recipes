This will be my first website since 6th form college over 20 years ago.
It will be a basic website for recipes.
It will demonstrate basic HTML such as headings, bold, emphasis, images and links.
It will be my first foray into using git/github.
Writing this, for the first time I understand why readme files always look so boring.
